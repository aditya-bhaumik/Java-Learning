       Greater than or equal to: a >= b

/* Java has the following conditional statements:
   Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
   Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
   Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
   Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.*/

  // The if Statement//
      if(20 > 18){
        System.out.println("20 is greater than 18");
      }
    
   }
}
